Issue
    Applies to: Toshiba laptop computers (Libretto 100CT, Satellite 3xx series including 300/305, 310/315, 320/325, 330/335, Satellite 2505, 4000 series, Satellite Pro 490/490X, Portege 320, 7000/7010 series, Tecra 550, 750, 780, Tecra 8000 series or newer.)

    These units are equipped with a PCI-based fast IrDA port which cannot be configured to print via the IrDA port, or transfer data via the IrDA port using anything other than IntelliSync software.

    This is because there is no native driver support for this type of device under Windows 95. This problem does not apply to Windows 98 which includes native PCI IrDA support within the OS. 
Procedure

    Toshiba has developed a PCI IrDA driver to support IrDA data transferring, IrDA networking and IrDA printing for Windows 95. Download IRPCI95.EXE (V 1.0, 6-2-98) from the Toshiba Web Site.

Try to run SETYMF before Windows loads : http://www.tmeeco.eu/TKAYBSC
It sets up YMF71x chips completely and hopefully windows will then play along too, assuming the laptop isn't using YMF701, which is a different beast that my util is very unlikely to support.




I've been having this same problem on a 445CDX. You only have to disable irda. The other ports all work with sound. The 445 also works and boots from 16gb partitions.

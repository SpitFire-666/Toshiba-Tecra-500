Try to run SETYMF before Windows loads : http://www.tmeeco.eu/TKAYBSC
It sets up YMF71x chips completely and hopefully windows will then play along too, assuming the laptop isn't using YMF701, which is a different beast that my util is very unlikely to support.




I've been having this same problem on a 445CDX. You only have to disable irda. The other ports all work with sound. The 445 also works and boots from 16gb partitions.
